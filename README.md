# Evaluating Classification Algorithms for Predicting Loan Risk Applications
The project focuses on evaluating various classification algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to predict loan risk applications. The objective is to develop a reliable predictive model to identify potential loan defaulters and assess loan risk effectively.
